        <p>
          There once was a little girl, who lived in a secret world. That world was full of rainbows and sunshine, little happy places and smiling faces. Every little thing was ment to serve her joy. There weren't many people, but there were plenty creatures. All to give her love. She was trully happy there, but sometimes she felt alone and she tought she needs to be surrounded with other people. But she really liked being on her own, she didn't hate people, she even liked watching them and placing them in her little imaginary world. So she used them as characters in her dreams. They fit perfectly and she didn't felt as alone like before.
        </p>
        <p>
          She used many tools to make this dream a reality. It was hard, because she didn't knew how to choose and she always just showed a sneak peak version of her favourite place and it was magical. Through the years the magic faded little by little and she soon realized she has to grow up and forget this little happy world. But she didn't gave in, she still dreams about it and let it live inside her for as long as she will live. But it wasn't always great and happy, sometimes silly and bad things come through and it's ok. As long as the happiness inside that dream doesn't fade. Then the magic will never die.
